= 1.3.1 / 2007-10-09

* Tests/README update for case sensitivity change

= 1.3.0 / 2007-10-09

* Conversion to Ragel-based parser (faster, less resource-intensive)
* Better support for other character sets, allow apostrophes in unquoted words
* Test suite now uses test/spec
* API is almost backwards compatible (though keywords/values are now case sensitive; downcase the input manually if you want the old behavior)

= 1.2.0 / 2007-05-09

* Raises KeywordSearch::ParseError instead of returning an empty Hash if an error occurs during parsing

= 1.1.0 / 2007-03-21

* Updated to use Dhaka 2.1.0

= 1.0.5 / 2007-01-29

* Added single quoting support and nested quotes (apostrophes, etc)
* Added a few more punctuation marks as valid input

= 1.0.4 / 2007-01-15

* Updated Dhaka dependency to lock to version 0.0.6 due to breakage of backwards compatibility in 1.0.0.
  Will update to allow 1.0.0+ once changes to Dhaka API stabilize (thanks to Dhaka author Mushfeq Khan for the tip)

== 1.0.0 / 2007-01-08

* Initial release
