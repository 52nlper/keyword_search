    by Bruce Williams

== DESCRIPTION:
  
Generic library to parse GMail-style search strings for keyword/value pairs; supports definition of valid keywords and handling of quoted values.

== FEATURES:
  
The library features a very simple, easy-to-use API.
* Define handlers for supported keywords with blocks
* Define the default keyword (values not part of a keyword/value pair)

Development Roadmap:
2.0:: Add negation and grouping (will break API backwards compatibility)

Note:: As of 1.3.0, input to KeywordSearch.search is no longer automatically downcased, allowing for case sensitive keyword and value pairs.  If you want case insensitivity, downcase the input before you invoke the method.

== SYNOPSIS:

Here's an example of usage from Rails (though the library is generic, and could presumably be used for any Ruby project)

  # Some variables to build up
  clauses = []
  arguments = []

  # Search a string, defining the supported keywords and building up
  # the variables in the associated closures
  
  KeywordSearch.search('account has:attachment since:2006-12-03') do |with|

    with.default_keyword :title
  
    with.keyword :title do |values|
      clauses << "title like ?"
      arguments << "%#{values.join(' ')}%"
    end
  
    with.keyword :has do |values|
      clauses << 'has_attachment = true' if values.include?('attachment')
    end
  
    with.keyword :since do |values|
      date = Date.parse(values.first) # only support one
      clauses << 'created_on >= ?'
      arguments << date.to_s
    end
  
  end
  
  # Do our search with <tt>clauses</tt> and <tt>arguments</tt>
  conditions = [clauses.map{|c| "(#{c})"}.join(' AND ')), *arguments] # simplistic example
  results = Message.find(:all, :conditions => conditions)
